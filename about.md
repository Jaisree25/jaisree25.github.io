Hi, I’m **Jaisree David Ravikumar**, and I’ve always been fascinated by machines that can learn, adapt, and interact with the world around them. That curiosity has shaped my path toward becoming an AI engineer, where I work with artificial intelligence, robotics, and intelligent systems. Along the way, I’ve worked on projects ranging from neural network models to robotics applications, driven by the goal of building systems that are not only intelligent but also reliable and impactful. For me, research is not just about solving technical challenges but about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and sharing that knowledge with others. This site is where I collect my research notes, projects, and publications, reflecting on both the experiments that succeed and the lessons learned from those that don’t. It’s a living record of my journey in AI and a way to connect with others who share the same passion for discovery.
