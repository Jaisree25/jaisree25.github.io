Collaborated in building a full-stack Chrome extension and FastAPI backend to detect and watermark AI-generated images using concepts such as DCT. Worked closely with a team to divide tasks, integrate frontend and backend components, and refine detection accuracy. The tool identifies the source generator (e.g., OpenAI, Perplexity) and integrates Python, FastAPI, and JavaScript for real-time processing.
