Led a team to build a wildfire risk detection tool using satellite imagery. Designed and trained a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and OpenCV to identify high-risk regions based on image features with 94% accuracy. Used Flask to serve model outputs through a simple web interface to deliver a functional prototype under time constraints.
